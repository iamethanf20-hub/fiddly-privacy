    <h1>Privacy Policy for Findly</h1>
    <p class="update-date">Last Updated: October 29, 2025</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Findly is an image search application that helps you find text and objects in photos. We are committed to protecting your privacy and handle your data with care.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1. Photos and Camera Access</h3>
    <p>Findly requires access to your camera and photo library to analyze images. All image processing happens locally on your device. We do not upload, store, or transmit your images to any external servers.</p>

    <h3>2. Usage Data</h3>
    <p>We store your monthly search count locally on your device to enforce the free tier limit of 15 searches per month. This data never leaves your device and is used solely for quota management.</p>

    <h3>3. Subscription Information</h3>
    <p>If you purchase Findly Premium, your subscription is managed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We receive only your subscription status (active or expired) from Apple. We do not have access to your payment information, credit card details, or other financial data.</p>
    <p>For more information about how Apple handles your data, see <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h3>4. Advertising Data (Free Users Only)</h3>
    <p>The free version of Findly displays advertisements powered by Google AdMob. AdMob may collect the following data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Approximate location (for ad targeting)</li>
        <li>Device identifiers (Advertising ID/IDFA)</li>
        <li>Ad interaction data (views, clicks)</li>
        <li>Device information (type, operating system version)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is collected and managed by Google, not by Findly. Premium subscribers do not see ads and this data is not collected for them.</p>
    <p>For more information, see <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
